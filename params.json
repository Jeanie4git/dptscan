{"name":"dptscan","body":"### Overview\r\n_idptscan_ implements iDPT approach, which **i**ntegrates signal **D**econvolution, whole genome **P**attern recognition and scan, and differential **T**esting into a consolidated pipeline, to compare groups of enrichment profiles generated by massively parallel sequencing.\r\n\r\n_idptscan_ has two parts. The first part is a command line tool that takes a simple configuration file to set running parameters and a straightforward sample sheet file to import sample information. It then passes all the data to the second part, which implements the iDPT analysis modules for preprocessing and normalization, signal deconvolution, genome-wide de novo pattern recognition and scan, statistical testing for differential assessment, and finally reporting. _idptscan_ fulfills the analysis by deploying a multi-stage, split-and-conquer strategy utilizing R parallel computation. The error recovery and logging system are built as part of the pipeline to achieve fault tolerance and easy debugging. Finally, an iDPT workspace is built and can be used for advanced configuration, analysis diagnostics, or downstream analyses such as functional analysis and data visualization.\r\n\r\nCheck [dptscan gitbub project](https://github.com/iDPT/dptscan) for its use.\r\n \r\n### References\r\nXu Y, Hu B, Choi AJ, Gopalan B, Lee BH, Kalady MF, Church JM, and Ting AH.
